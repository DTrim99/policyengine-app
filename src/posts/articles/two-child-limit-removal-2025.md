The two-child limit is a UK welfare policy that restricts child-related benefits to the first two children in a family for children born after April 2017. This policy affects the Universal Credit (UC) as well as the Child Tax Credit (CTC).

PolicyEngine allows modelling both the current implementation and [policy reforms](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/feb/26/parents-under-fives-could-be-exempted-two-child-benefit-cap-uk) to the two-child limit, including an age-based exemption mechanism.

# Current policy implementation

The two-child limit currently applies to:

- Universal Credit child elements
- Child Tax Credit child elements

By default, families can only claim these benefits for their first two children, with some exceptions:

1. Children born before April 6, 2017 are exempt from the limit
2. Multiple births (e.g., twins or triplets) where only one child would take the family over the two-child limit
3. Children adopted from local authority care
4. Children living with family or friends (kinship care)
5. Children born as a result of non-consensual conception

PolicyEngine currently models the date-based exemption (children born before April 2017) and does not model the other exemption conditions. When using these parameters for policy analysis, please note:

1. The age exemption applies to the family as a whole - if any child is under the threshold, all children are exempt.
2. The exemption adds to existing exemptions (e.g., children born before April 2017 are unaffected).

# Economic impact of the reform

Using PolicyEngine’s microsimulation model, we estimate that limiting the Universal Credit (UC) and Child Tax Credit (CTC) child cap to families with children under 5 years old in 2025 would cost [£479.9 million](https://policyengine.org/uk/policy?focus=policyOutput.policyBreakdown&reform=77113&region=uk&timePeriod=2025&baseline=1) and [£24.5 million](https://policyengine.org/uk/policy?reform=77112&focus=policyOutput.policyBreakdown&region=uk&timePeriod=2025&baseline=1) respectively, while limiting the UC [reduces poverty by 0.3%](https://policyengine.org/uk/policy?focus=policyOutput.povertyImpact.regular.byAge&reform=77113&region=uk&timePeriod=2025&baseline=1).

When considering applying the child limit to the UC and CTC in combination, the cost increases to £504.3 million, [decreasing child poverty by 0.6%](https://policyengine.org/uk/policy?focus=policyOutput.povertyImpact.regular.byAge&reform=77114&region=uk&timePeriod=2025&baseline=1).

The combined reform will increase net income for [5% of the population](https://policyengine.org/uk/policy?focus=policyOutput.winnersAndLosers.incomeDecile&reform=77114&region=uk&timePeriod=2025&baseline=1), with the largest impact in the 5th decile, benefiting over 10% of the population.

# Conclusion

The current two-child limit restricts child-related benefits (Universal Credit and Child Tax Credit) to the first two children born after April 2017.

PolicyEngine estimates that exempting families with children under 5 years old from this limit would cost £504.3 million, while reducing child poverty by 0.6% and benefiting 5% of the population in 2025.
