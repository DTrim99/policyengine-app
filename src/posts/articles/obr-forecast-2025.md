# Analysis of the Spring 2025 OBR Economic Forecast

Tomorrow, the Office for Budget Responsibility will release its Spring 2025 Economic and Fiscal Outlook, updating government forecasts for key economic indicators and tax and spending programs. At PolicyEngine, we'll be integrating these new projections into our microsimulation model to provide updated forecasts on household income, poverty rates, and inequality measures.

## What we'll analyze

After incorporating the new OBR growth factors into PolicyEngine, we'll examine:

1. **Household income projections** through 2030, showing year-on-year changes in real household net income by income decile
2. **Poverty rate forecasts** by demographic group (children, working-age adults, seniors)
3. **Inequality measures** including the Gini coefficient and P90/P10 ratio

## Impact on fiscal aggregates

We'll assess how the new OBR forecasts affect major fiscal components:

- Income tax receipts
- National Insurance contributions
- VAT and other indirect taxes
- Universal Credit and legacy benefit expenditure
- Pension and disability benefit spending

## Poverty and distributional analysis

Our analysis will focus on how updated economic projections affect:

- Absolute and relative poverty rates across different demographic groups
- Changes in household disposable income by income decile
- Geographic distribution of economic impacts

## Comparison with previous forecasts

We'll examine how the new projections differ from previous OBR forecasts and explain the key factors driving these changes.

The full analysis will be published following the OBR's release tomorrow.
