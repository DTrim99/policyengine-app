On January 13th, Congressman Blake Moore (R-UT) [introduced](https://blakemoore.house.gov/media/press-releases/congressman-blake-moore-introduces-legislation-to-enhance-the-child-tax-credit-and-provide-tax-relief-for-parents) the [Family First Act (FFA)](https://blakemoore.house.gov/imo/media/doc/ctc_bill_text.pdf), which would reform several tax provisions starting in 2026 after the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act expires. This analysis uses PolicyEngine's microsimulation model to estimate its impacts on household incomes, poverty, inequality, and federal revenue.

- **Child Tax Credit**: Increases amounts to $4,200 (up to age five) and $3,000 (ages six to 17), up to six children. Introduces a phase-in from $0 to $20,000 of earnings, continues a phase-out at $200,000 ($400,000 joint).
- **Pregnant Mother’s Credit**: Offers up to $2,800 per newborn, with a phase-in until $10,000 of earnings.
- **EITC**: Consolidates the structure from eight to four household types, phases in at existing rates for no children (7.65%) and one child (34%), and adjusts phase-outs.
- **Head of Household Filing Status**: Repeals the status entirely.
- **Dependent Exemptions**: Continues the dependent exemption repeal from the TCJA period into 2026 and beyond.
- **Child and Dependent Care Credit**: Restricts eligibility to dependents aged 18+ who cannot self-care due to disability.
- **SALT Deduction**: Retains the $10,000 deduction cap in 2026 and beyond.

See **Table A.1** in the Appendix for a detailed comparison of FFA, current policy (under TCJA), and current law (post-TCJA).

# Defining the Reform

## Child Tax Credit (CTC)

The FFA expands the CTC from $1,000 to $4,200 for children up to age five and $3,000 for children ages six to 17, up to six children per filer. It phases in from $0 to $20,000 of earnings and phases out at 5% above $200,000 ($400,000 joint), retaining the TCJA thresholds of 2018–2025. Under current law in 2026, the threshold would revert to $75,000 ($110,000 joint).

## Pregnant Mother’s Credit

The FFA adds a pregnant mother’s credit of up to $2,800 for each newborn. It phases in until $10,000 of earnings.

## Reform of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)

The FFA consolidates eight existing EITC household types (single/married and 0/1/2/3+ children) into four (single/married and 0/1+ children). The phase-in rate remains 7.65% for households without children and 34% for those with children. The phase-out rate becomes 10% for households without children and 25% for households with children, compared to 7.65% and up to 21.06% today.

## Repeal of Head of Household Filing Status

The FFA repeals head of household filing status, which increases tax thresholds for single parents under current policy.

## Repeal of Dependent Exemptions

The TCJA repealed dependent exemptions from 2018 to 2025. Starting in 2026, these exemptions would return at $5,300. The FFA continues their repeal, maintaining the TCJA approach.

## Repeal Child Portion of the Child and Dependent Care Credit (CDCC)

The FFA limits the CDCC to dependent care expenses for individuals who are 18 or older and unable to self-care due to disability. Currently, the CDCC is available for children under 13.

## Cap the State and Local Tax (SALT) Deduction

The $10,000 SALT deduction cap from the TCJA is scheduled to expire in 2026. The FFA would keep the $10,000 cap in place.

# Household Impacts of the Family First Act

Consider a single parent with two children, ages five and ten, earning $30,000 in Utah. Under the FFA, [household net income increases by $1,835](https://policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.netIncome&reform=73466&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=2&household=48565). The increase comes from a $5,395 expansion in the Child Tax Credit, partially offset by reductions in tax credits and increased tax liability. The federal EITC falls by $1,688, and the Utah EITC, which matches the federal credit, decreases by $338. The household pays $1,854 more in tax before credits due to the elimination of both dependent exemptions and head of household filing status.

This household's experience varies with income. Net income rises until earnings reach $188,000, after which the gains diminish and eventually become losses. At $350,000 of earnings, the household faces its largest reduction in net income of $5,900.

The reform affects single-parent and married households differently, with variations based on income level and number of children. Figure 1 shows how these impacts vary by household type and income level.

![Net income changes by household type and income](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2656/0*lKs_ij6_V1sEyJdU)
_Figure 1. Annual change in household net income under the Family First Act by marital status and number of children_

Single-parent households can see net income decrease by up to $10,000, with the largest reductions occurring at incomes between $300,000 and $400,000. The magnitude of change increases with the number of children in the household. Married households, in contrast, experience net income increases of up to $4,000-$5,000 until their earnings exceed $400,000. Above $600,000, the impact becomes minimal. As with single-parent households, those with more children see larger changes in net income due to the expanded Child Tax Credit.

When households have childcare expenses, the impacts shift. A household with $10,000 in childcare expenses sees up to $3,000 less in net income due to changes in the Child and Dependent Care Credit. Married households maintain net gains until reaching about $420,000 in earnings, after which the gains gradually decline. Single households experience a steeper decline in net income as earnings grow, reflecting the reformed EITC structure designed to reduce marriage penalties.

Figure 2 illustrates these patterns for a specific household type [across the income distribution](https://policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.earnings&reform=73466&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=2&household=48565).

_Figure 2. Annual change in household net income under the Family First Act by earnings level for a single parent with two children_

The reform creates [substantial changes in marginal tax rates](https://policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.mtr&reform=73466&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=2&household=48565), particularly for households earning under $50,000. As shown in Figure 3, tax rates shift between 30 percentage points lower and 29 percentage points higher than current law. These changes stem from the interaction of various provisions: credits phasing in and out at different income levels, modifications to deductions, and the elimination of head of household filing status.

# National Impacts of the Family First Act

We estimate national impacts using the PolicyEngine US microsimulation model. See Appendix B for methodological details.

## Federal Revenue Effects

The FFA raises [$24.3 billion](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.policyBreakdown&reform=73465&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=2) in net revenue in 2026. While the Child Tax Credit expansion (including the pregnant mother's credit) reduces revenue by $170 billion, other provisions—particularly maintaining the SALT deduction cap—raise $111.2 billion. Figure 1 shows the revenue impact of each component.

![Revenue effects by provision](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*1WWqPxqlKr2yN3ds9BZzfQ.png)
_Figure 1. Budgetary impact of Family First Act provisions in 2026_

Over the 2026-2034 period, the reform raises $494.4 billion, with federal revenue gains growing each year as shown in Figure 2.

![Revenue effects over time](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2640/0*mwlUL3jthCnKvis8)
_Figure 2. Annual federal budgetary impact, 2025-2034_

The annual federal impacts are:

| Year                           | 2025 | 2026  | 2027  | 2028  | 2029  | 2030  | 2031  | 2032  | 2033  | 2034  | Total  |
| ------------------------------ | ---- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ------ |
| Federal Budgetary Impact ($bn) | 0.0  | -20.4 | -27.2 | -34.9 | -43.0 | -52.3 | -62.3 | -73.0 | -84.0 | -97.3 | -494.4 |

## State Revenue Effects

State revenues rise by $3.9 billion in 2026, mainly from state-level credits that match federal amounts. States such as Colorado (25%), Connecticut (40%), Louisianna (5%), and others provide income tax credits, mathcing the federal EITC amount by a varying percentage. Additionally, states such as Arkansas (20%), Colorado (up to 50%), Delaware (50%), and others match the federal CDCC amount under state specific child and dependent care income tax credits.[^1]

## Changes in Income Distribution

The reform affects household incomes across the income distribution, as shown in Figure 3. [Net income rises for 36% of people and falls for 16%](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.winnersAndLosers.incomeDecile&reform=73466&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=2). The ninth income decile sees the highest share of households with income gains (47%), while the top decile has the highest share with income losses (49%).

![Distribution of gains and losses](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*f-gK9uscrzd-5170)
_Figure 3. Share of people with income gains and losses by income decile_

## Poverty Reduction

The reform [reduces poverty by 5.9%](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.povertyImpact.regular.byAge&reform=73466&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=2) overall (a 1.5 percentage point reduction in the Supplemental Poverty Measure). As shown in Figure 4, child poverty falls by 10.7%, while deep poverty—households below half the poverty line—declines by 2.1%.

![Poverty reduction by age group](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*Xp698QhswZMUp5u6)
_Figure 4. Change in poverty rates by age group_

The reform also reduces income inequality, [lowering the Gini index by 1.4%](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.inequalityImpact&reform=73466&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=2). The share of total income held by the top 1% of households falls by 3.1%.

# Conclusion

Congressman Blake Moore’s Family First Act modifies multiple tax policies. The bill changes the Earned Income Tax Credit, Child Tax Credit, Child and Dependent Care Credit, and SALT deduction, and it repeals head of household filing status and dependent exemptions. We project that these reforms would raise $494.4 billion in federal revenues from 2026 to 2034, with the amount increasing annually. According to our simulation, the reform raises net income for 36% of the population and reduces poverty by 5.9% (and child poverty by 10.7%).

[^2]: Analysis conducted in [this public GitHub repository](https://github.com/PolicyEngine/analysis-notebooks/tree/main/us/family_first_act) using the policyengine-us Python package.

[^3]: The distributional impacts include changes from state-level tax credits, such as the Utah EITC, which matches 20% of the federal credit in 2026.

# Appendix B: Simulation Methodology

## Data and Software

This analysis uses:

- PolicyEngine US version 1.172.0 microsimulation model
- Enhanced Current Population Survey microdata
- 2026 tax parameters from current law
- GitHub repository documenting code and parameters

## Key Assumptions

The simulation:

- Compares FFA to current law baseline after TCJA expiration
- Assumes no behavioral responses to policy changes
- Models full CTC takeup
- Models partial EITC takeup based on IRS Taxpayer Advocate Service estimates
- Includes state tax interactions where credits match federal amounts
- Projects parameters forward using statutory inflation adjustments

## Margin of Error

Results are point estimates from survey microdata. Sampling error and modeling uncertainty affect precision. Key sources of uncertainty include:

- CPS sampling variation
- Income and demographic reporting error
- Tax filing unit construction from households
- Benefit takeup assumptions
- Economic projection uncertainty

## Code and Data Access

The complete analysis code is available in a public GitHub repository. The PolicyEngine US package provides the tax-benefit calculator and Enhanced CPS provides the microdata.
