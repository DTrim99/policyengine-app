Following the Senate‚Äôs July 1st passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), we‚Äôre launching the [**OBBBA Household Explorer**](../obbba-household-explorer) ‚Äî an interactive dashboard that shows how this reconciliation bill would affect individual households across America.

[**_Explore Households with our new tool here._**](../obbba-household-explorer)

## What the tool does

The OBBBA Household Explorer allows users to explore the bill‚Äôs impacts on over 40,000 representative households from PolicyEngine‚Äôs [Enhanced Current Population Survey](https://policyengine.org/us/research/enhanced-cps-beta) (CPS) dataset. This dataset integrates and calibrates multiple data sources using machine learning techniques ‚Äî the same foundation that powers PolicyEngine‚Äôs simulations of policy effects on poverty, inequality, and government budgets, when paired with our comprehensive model of federal, state, and local income tax and benefit programs.

The OBBBA extends provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act set to expire at the end of 2025, while introducing new elements including:

- Tax exemptions for tip and overtime income

- Modifications to the Child Tax Credit

- Changes to the SALT deduction cap

- Cuts to SNAP, Medicaid, and Affordable Care Act Premium Tax Credits

By capturing these and more as of 2026, we show the breadth of the bills‚Äô impacts on households that collectively represent the nation.

## Examples

To illustrate the tool‚Äôs capabilities, let‚Äôs explore two households. While both are couples around 60 years old, varying attributes and analysis configurations shows how results vary.

### Couple in Montana, Senate bill against current law

First consider household **#66994**, a couple in Montana, ages 53 and 61, with $214,850 income.

Comparing the Senate bill to current law, they would gain $13,577, paying $11,831 less in federal tax and $1,746 less in state tax.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*_xZhF7_TUE_RT5Eh)

That $13,577 gain results from reforms to the tax brackets, standard deduction, qualified business income deduction, and overtime income exemption, less a $2,332 loss from the repeal of exemptions.

We can also select state taxes to explore the $1,746 gain, finding that it results from the standard deduction reform. Beginning in 2024, Montana adopted the federal standard deduction by statute. PolicyEngine‚Äôs [TAXSIM](http://taxsim.nber.org)-validated tax model captures these interactions between federal and state policy.

### Couple in Georgia, House bill against current policy

Next let‚Äôs consider household **#43826**, a Georgia couple with $71,820 income.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*0tcLOTIau2vDApZe)

This household would pay $1,023 less in federal tax, while losing $1,971 in benefits, for a net loss of $947.

Like the Montana couple, this couple benefits from the standard deduction reform and overtime exemption.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/0*y8DvE7OXLVAZvd7R)

However, they lose $1,971 in Affordable Care Act Premium Tax Credits, whose enhancements (which are part of current policy) expire at the end of 2025.

PolicyEngine counts premium tax credits as benefits since they are subsidized premiums throughout the year. Our rules engine calculates these credits to the dollar. Additionally, our rules engine calculates the dollar impacts of households modeled to lose SNAP and Medicaid access, per projections from the Congressional Budget Office.

## Key features

To go beyond these examples (and household **#139385 **for this report‚Äôs cover image), you can leverage the tool‚Äôs full set of features.

### üé≤ Quick exploration

The **Get Random Household** button lets you instantly explore impacts across America‚Äôs diverse population. Each click reveals a different household, weighted by population representation ‚Äî allowing rapid exploration of how impacts vary by circumstance.

### üìä Comprehensive analysis

The tool analyzes impacts on:

- **Federal taxes**: Changes from tax rate adjustments, deductions, and credits

- **State taxes**: How federal changes affect state income tax liability

- **Net income**: Combined effect on take-home pay

### üîç Detailed filtering

Find households similar to your situation by:

- State

- Income level

### üìà Provision-by-provision breakdown

Interactive waterfall charts show exactly how each reform component contributes to the total impact:

And analyze both:

- **House version**: Passed May 22, 2025

- **Senate version**: Passed July 1, 2025

### Representative data you can trust

The tool uses PolicyEngine‚Äôs Enhanced CPS dataset, which represents the full diversity of American households. This allows exploration of impacts across different:
