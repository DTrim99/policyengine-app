## Platform evolution

Our platform underwent major technological advances to enhance both capability and accessibility:

### Behavioural response modelling

We introduced sophisticated [behavioural response modelling](https://policyengine.org/uk/research/behavioural-responses) for both labour supply and capital gains, enabling more nuanced analysis of how policy changes influence individual economic decisions. This advancement allows users to better understand the dynamic effects of tax and benefit reforms.

### AI-powered explanations

Our new [AI-powered tax and benefit explanations](https://policyengine.org/uk/research/uk-household-ai) break down complex calculations into clear, understandable language. This feature makes policy analysis more accessible to users regardless of their technical background.

### Enhanced user experience

The introduction of user accounts now allows researchers and policy analysts to save and track their policy simulations over time, facilitating more comprehensive longitudinal analysis.

## Policy analysis impact

### Election year coverage

In preparation for the election, we provided detailed analysis of major party manifestos:

- [Labour](https://policyengine.org/uk/research/labour-2024-manifesto)

- [Conservatives](https://policyengine.org/uk/research/conservative-2024-manifesto)

- [Liberal Democrats](https://policyengine.org/uk/research/lib-dem-2024-manifesto)

Our innovative [manifesto comparison calculator](https://policyengine.org/uk/2024-manifestos) enabled citizens to understand both personal and societal impacts of each party’s platform.

With [support from the Nuffield Foundation](https://policyengine.org/uk/research/uk-nuffield-grant), we’re embarking on several initiatives to further enhance PolicyEngine UK in 2025:

- Creating representative micro-datasets for each local authority and constituency

- Integrating childcare subsidies and public service spending analysis

- Developing an open dashboard for model validation
