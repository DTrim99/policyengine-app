In 2024, PolicyEngine US achieved significant milestones in democratizing policy analysis through technological innovation and comprehensive coverage of major policy developments. Together with our [achievements in the UK](https://policyengine.org/uk/research/uk-year-in-review-2024), we've expanded the frontier of evidence-based policymaking on both sides of the Atlantic.Here’s a detailed look at our achievements and impact this year.

## Evolving the platform

Our platform underwent major technological advances to enhance both capability and accessibility. We launched the [Enhanced Current Population Survey dataset](https://policyengine.org/us/research/enhanced-cps-beta), which leverages machine learning to provide more accurate microsimulation modeling. This advancement allows for more precise analysis of policy impacts across different demographic groups.

We introduced comprehensive [state income tax models](https://policyengine.org/us/research/state-tax-model-beta) for all 50 states and DC, enabling analysis of state-specific reforms and their interaction with federal policy.

Our new [behavioral response capabilities](https://policyengine.org/us/research/us-behavioral-response) capture how policy reforms affect labor supply based on customizable elasticities, enabling more nuanced analysis of how tax and benefit changes influence individual economic decisions.

This fall, we launched our [AI-powered tax and benefit explanations system](https://policyengine.org/us/research/us-household-ai), which translates complex calculations into clear, understandable language. This feature makes policy analysis more accessible to users regardless of their technical background.

## Informing the electorate

During this election year, we developed comprehensive analyses of major policy proposals, including a [calculator](https://policyengine.org/us/2024-election-calculator) showing the personal impacts of presidential candidates’ tax plans. We analyzed Harris’ [Child Tax Credit](https://policyengine.org/us/research/harris-ctc) and [Earned Income Tax Credit](https://policyengine.org/us/research/harris-eitc) expansions, as well as Trump’s [Social Security tax exemption](https://policyengine.org/us/research/social-security-tax-exemption) and [Tax Cuts and Jobs Act extension](https://policyengine.org/us/research/tcja-extension). Our analysis extended to state-level policies, including the [Oregon Rebate ballot measure](https://policyengine.org/us/research/oregon-rebate).

## Expanding benefit access and personal tax insights

We broadened our suite of specialized calculators and tools in 2024, launching the country’s first standalone [Child Tax Credit calculator](https://policyengine.org/us/child-tax-credit-calculator) and introducing [GiveCalc](https://policyengine.org/us/research/givecalc) to help donors understand the tax implications of their charitable contributions. Our API now powers innovative services like [MyFriendBen](https://www.myfriendben.org/), which received a [$2.4 million grant](http://awarded) from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and [Benefit Navigator](https://www.imaginela.org/benefit-navigator), which serves over 500 case managers across Los Angeles County.

## Growing our impact

Our research and tools gained recognition across sectors throughout 2024. We presented our work at major academic conferences including the National Tax Association Spring Symposium and Annual Conference, APPAM, BenCon, and the Open Sustainability Summit. Universities including UC Berkeley, Northwestern University, and George Mason University invited us to share our research.

Our analysis informed policy discussions at various levels, from Congress — where Rep. Morgan McGarvey [referenced our work](https://mcgarvey.house.gov/media/press-releases/congressman-morgan-mcgarvey-introduces-young-adult-tax-credit-act) in the Young Adult Tax Credit Act — to think tanks, with organizations like the Niskanen Center utilizing our tools for [policy analysis](https://policyengine.org/us/research/niskanen-center-analysis).

## Planning for a transformative 2025

Looking ahead to 2025, we’re expanding our capabilities with API access to our AI-powered explanation system launching in Q1. We’ll continue enhancing our state-level analysis capabilities, expanding behavioral response modeling, and developing additional policy reform calculators to further democratize sophisticated policy analysis, especially in a critical year full of tax and benefit policy debates at all levels of government.
